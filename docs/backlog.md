# Project Backlog: Programming Procedures

## User Stories

### User Story 1
**As a** Java developer  
**I want to** create a comprehensive suite of unit tests for the authentication module using JUnit  
**So that** I can ensure its reliability and achieve good code coverage.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] The JUnit testing environment is configured in the project.
- [ ] Unit tests are written for all critical functions of the reservations module.
- [ ] A code coverage report confirms at least 90% coverage.
- [ ] All implemented tests pass without errors.

### User Story 2
**As a** JavaScript developer  
**I want to** develop unit tests for the frontend authentication module using Jest  
**So that** I can validate its functionality and ensure good code coverage.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] The Jest testing environment is set up for the JavaScript module.
- [ ] Unit tests cover all key features of the graph visualization.
- [ ] A code coverage report shows at least 90% test coverage.
- [ ] All Jest tests run successfully.

### User Story 3
**As a** developer  
**I want to** create complete and clear project documentation  
**So that** current and future developers can understand, install, and maintain the system.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Documentation includes detailed installation and setup instructions.
- [ ] Information about the implemented unit tests and how to run them is included.
- [ ] The codebase is well-commented.
- [ ] System diagrams are created and added to the documentation.

### User Story 4
**As a** developer  
**I want to** have a well-organized GitHub repository  
**So that** all project artifacts, including code, tests, and documentation, are easily accessible.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] The repository has a clear directory structure.
- [ ] All code, tests, and documentation are committed to the repository.
- [ ] The `README.md` file is updated with relevant project information.
